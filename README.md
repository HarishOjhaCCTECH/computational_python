# Computational Python
- Purpose: Learn the python to use in mathematical equation, which will be helpful in data science and machine learning

## Structure:
- Technologies used: Python Language, Visual Studio 2022 IDE, Numpy Library, Matplotlib Library
- The project contans two files, main.py and maths.py
- main.py  contains the usage of the classes from maths.py
- maths.py contains two classes: class Analysis, class Algebra
- Class Analysis contains the Lagrange's Interpolation method, which gives us the missing Y value of any given X value using already collected Xs,Ys
- Class Algebra contains the Gauss Elimination method, which helps us to solve a set of equations, given that it contains all unique equations
 
## Input:
- QUESTION1:
![Interpolate](https://github.com/HarishOjhaCCTECH/computational_python/assets/158055492/052b92a0-6b34-42e3-94b4-f8dc36e2db81)


- QUESTION2:
![Gauss](https://github.com/HarishOjhaCCTECH/computational_python/assets/158055492/89f8d63a-4a15-4696-b894-57a678e52928)

## Output:
- ANSWER1: GIVING THE MISSING Y VALUE

-ANSWER2: GOT DIVIDE BY ZERO ERROR BECAUSE THE THIRD ROW BECAME ZERO, WHICH MEANS THE EQUATIONS CAN'T BE SOLVED
